# Portfolio

My Task

This was my very first homework challenge with being tasked to build a basic website. 

To complete the task I was instructed to create a very simple Portfolio page using the Bootstrap library.

Being the very first website I have ever done, this assignent did present some challenges, but the learning process was certainly rewarding.
